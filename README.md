The project consists of a password analyzer in Python. Its aim is to evaluate the strength of a password entered by the user according to predefined criteria,
such as password length and the presence of different character types (lowercase letters, uppercase letters, numbers, special characters). The program provides feedback
to the user on the quality of their password, indicating whether it is weak, medium or strong, as well as suggestions for improvement. In addition, the project includes an estimate
of the time needed to crack the password, depending on its complexity, giving the user a better understanding of what's at stake when it comes to data security.
The project can be extended with additional functionalities such as secure password generation, integration with data leakage verification APIs,
or a graphical user interface for enhanced user experience.
